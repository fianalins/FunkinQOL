## [0.5.0] - Prerelease - 2024-10-14
Most features work, others are broken. This is an experimental branch for this specific update, don't expect this to come out any time soon.

### Everything
- Updated game to have the Pico Update. This required redoing/going into the file and retyping most things, some things able to be copied and pasted!
### Changed
- Experimental Flag for base game Ghost Tapping switches completely over to the experimental version.

### Known Issues
- Health Bar does not work.
  - Using Colored bar makes the `dark` variation characters throw an error. I have no clue why.
- Probably a lot more

### Extra
- This uses base game save data!! If you choose to build this you are risking everything!
  - A bug with the base game itself causes older versions of the game to delete all save data!! Back everything up!

Unless you want to be like me and lose all my gold P ranks...

## [0.4.0] - 2024-8-17
### Added
- [Colored Health Bar dependant on Icons.](#info-about-colored-health-bar)
- [Independent Save File](#info-about-new-save-data)
- New Bar to make changing colors easier.
- FPS Cap option. The actual FPS the game runs at will be higher than the cap, and it is disproportionate. At lower values it seems to be about 4 frames higher, however at the max of 360 I get about 480? It doesn't really matter.
### Changed
- Soft Health Bar Colors setting is replaced by Health Bar Color Type (Default, Soft, Icon Colored)
- All base characters now have new `"color"` value
- Bars now use new `BarUtil.hx`
- [Change UI Controls Order](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/pull/3027)
### Removed
- Merch button in Main Menu
### Fixed
- ONLY IN FINAL BUILD!! [Visualizer last bar not displaying + memory leak](#how-2-fix-funkinvis)
- [Fix Camera Tweening When Paused](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/pull/3098)
- [[BUGFIX] Player's left notes being selected when they shouldn't](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/pull/3093)
- [[BUGFIX] Animation Editor not saving the file name](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/pull/3090)
- [[BUGFIX] Ensure the variation used for the next song is valid.](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/pull/3037)
### Enhancement
- [[ENHANCEMENT] Custom Popups and Countdowns](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/pull/3020)
### Known Issues
- Senpai Erect (Erect and Nightmare) loops when reaching the end, probably caused due to either the fixed resync or something with the chart editor. When opening the song in the chart editor, then testing and going back, the end of the song disappears
- [Not fully bug tested.](#how-i-bug-test)
### Wanted Pull Requests - Reason Not Added
- [Add Mod Menu](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/pull/3060) - Crashes on Quit, no reordering. !!Issue with new haxeui stuff, crashes on Chart Editor as well!!
- [[ENHANCEMENT] Note Kind Scripts](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/pull/2635/files) - Too scared to add
- [[ENHANCEMENT] Softcode Week 5 Cutscenes](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/pull/2880) - Too scared because the [Custom Popups and Countdowns](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/pull/3020) changes some of the stuff because it was hardcoded
- [[ENHANCEMENT + BUGFIX] soft codable visualizers + polymod download fix](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/pull/2994) - For some unknown reason it removes the faces and hands to some of the poses in Blazin'??
### Info about Colored Health Bar
For the Colored Health Bar to work, there is a new Data Input called `"color"`. If there is no `"color"` string in the Character data file, it is defaulted to White
#### How to add Color
Inside of the .json file of the Character, you need to add the line
`"color": "#FF00AA",`
It does not matter where the line is put, just so long as it is in the file.

The color is formatted as a Hex Code value, however you can [read the documentation on FlxColor - fromString](https://api.haxeflixel.com/flixel/util/FlxColor.html#fromString) to see other ways you can format the string.
#### Stuffs I want to add
In the Character Debug page, there should be a way to add the Color input for the Character, and a preview, like Psych.
### How 2 Fix funkin.vis
I don't know how to do this hmm stuff + these are two seperate Pull Requests that need to be added

1. [Do this stuff](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/funkVis/pull/8/files)
2. [Do this other stuff](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/funkVis/pull/7/files)
### Info about New Save Data
All Save Data is being migrated to its own folder, `FunkinQoL-Dev`.

To make this work, instead of transferring from Legacy Funkin', the game first checks if you have a Save from the base game, and transfers all data to the new file. If you somehow don't have any Save Data, it then returns to checking Legacy Funkin'.

There is also a new shiny button in Options that lets you transfer any new data from base game. In theory.
### How I Bug Test
Pointless random stuff I feel like adding.

My standard testing procedure consists of

1. Seeing if the game builds properly.
2. Testing the feature I am adding.
3. Playing on normal difficulties, Erect remixes, pixel stages, non-pixel stages, etc. (depends on what is being added)
4. If it truly needs it, I'll test with different Preferences enabled or disabled.
5. Assume it is good to go and push to `experimental`.

6. End of the loop. Happens when I am satisfied with all the new stuff and decide it is time to update the finished product for all zero of you to enjoy.
