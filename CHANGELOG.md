### Added
- [Colored Health Bar dependant on Icons.](#info-about-colored-health-bar)

### Changed
- Soft Health Bar Colors setting is replaced by Health Bar Color Type (Default, Soft, Icon Colored)
- All base characters now have new `"color"` value
- Merch button has dissapeared
### Fixed
- ONLY IN FINAL BUILD!! [Visualizer last bar not displaying + memory leak](#how-2-fix-funkinvis)
### Known Issues
- Senpai Erect (Erect and Nightmare) loops when reaching the end, probably caused due to either the fixed resync or something with the chart editor. When opening the song in the chart editor, then testing and going back, the end of the song disappears
- Cannot build on my machine, geting stuck at the Git Commit ID (probably doesn't affect others)

- [[ENHANCEMENT] Softcode Week 5 Cutscenes](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/pull/2880/files) - Too scared because the [Custom Popups and Countdowns](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/pull/3020) changes some of the stuff because it was hardcoded

### Info about Colored Health Bar
For the Colored Health Bar to work, there is a new Data Input called `"color"`. If there is no `"color"` string in the Character data file, it is defaulted to White
#### How to add Color
Inside of the .json file of the Character, you need to add the line
`"color": "#FF00AA",`
It does not matter where the line is put, just so long as it is in the file.

The color is formatted as a Hex Code value, however you can [read the documentation on FlxColor - fromString](https://api.haxeflixel.com/flixel/util/FlxColor.html#fromString) to see other ways you can format the string.
#### Stuffs I want to add
In the Character Debug page, there should be a way to add the Color input for the Character, and a preview, like Psych.
#### What doesn't work
Not tested, but the way setting the Health Bar color is, I can't change the color on command so switching characters does not change the color. Copying Psych Engine and making a new Bar that can actually change the colors would make this work, but as much as I would like stealing, I won't. Also, there is no character switching in base game, and modding is not my main priority, otherwise I would've made this a script.
### How 2 Fix funkin.vis
I don't know how to do this hmm stuff + these are two seperate Pull Requests that need to be added

1. [Do this stuff](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/funkVis/pull/8/files)
2. [Do this other stuff](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/funkVis/pull/7/files)
### Info about New Save Data
All Save Data is being migrated to its own folder, `FunkinQoL-Dev`.

To make this work, instead of transferring from Legacy Funkin', the game first checks if you have a Save from the base game, and transfers all data to the new file. If you somehow don't have any Save Data, it then returns to checking Legacy Funkin'.

There is also a new shiny button in Options that lets you transfer any new data from base game. In theory.
