# Funkin' QoL

Funkin' QoL adds features that I personally think should be in the base game. As to why they aren't ranges from devs stating they don't want to add the feature (like middlescroll) or features like a colored healthbar for the various icons being what I think is too unreasonable for what the game wants to be.
