# QOL Changes for Funkin'

Friday Night Funkin' is a game. But the base engine has some problems, other than its offset strumline for the player.

Normal terms:
That is why I decided to create a fork that adds some nice features without completely overhauling the entire game. Because I am not a programmer.
Using my amazing skillset of looking at the other code and guessing what to do to make something happen by copying what is already there, I somehow changed the engine into being with more features than will ever be added. At least for now.

Gen Alpha terms:
That is why I decided to be a sigma alpha wolf and create a fork that adds some nice features without completely overhauling the entire game. Because I am not a programmer.
Using my skibidi skillset of looking at the other code and guessing what to do to make something happen by copying what has been on a mewing streak, I somehow rizzed the engine into being an omega fanum taxer. At least while they are still on their edging streak.
