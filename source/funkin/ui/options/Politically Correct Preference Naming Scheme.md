# Politcally Correct Preference Naming Scheme

This is for if I want to use better descriptions and names for the preferences.

## Guidelines

How you should properly create a title and description for preferences.

### Checkbox

- Checkboxes should ssy `Toggle` or `Change` in the description.
- Checkboxes should not have `Disable` or `Enable` or similar words in the title.

### Other

Other forms of options have a little more leniency with their titles and descriptions, but should still generally follow the same guidelines. This is because obviously you can't toggle a number value option, but still try and make everything uniform.

## Examples

Examples of proper titles and descriptions. These probably aren't going to actually be what show up, because this is just a "what if" for having a proper naming scheme. There is also probably going to be missing values in the case of an update and I forget or am too lazy.
